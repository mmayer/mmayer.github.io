# Welcome!

This is Markus Mayer&#8217;s site. I grew up in Austria near Vienna,
but now I live in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. You can find me
on [LinkedIn](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/mmayer/),
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/mm75) and [GitHub](http://github.com/mmayer/).

Currently, I primarily work on the Linux kernel for ARM-based embedded
systems, with a tiny bit of MIPS thrown in for good measure.
