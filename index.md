# Welcome!

This is Markus Mayer&#8217;s site. I grew up in Austria near Vienna, but now I
live in [Metro Vancouver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Vancouver),
British Columbia, Canada. You can find me on
[LinkedIn](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/mmayer/) and
[GitHub](http://github.com/mmayer/).

I am working on the Linux kernel for ARM-based embedded systems, with a tiny bit
of MIPS thrown in for good measure. As of late, I have also been doing quite a
bit of work with [Buildroot](https://www.buildroot.org).
